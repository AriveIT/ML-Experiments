An attempt of using the genetic algorithm for feature engineering. Current result is about as effective as a random search that tests the same number of terms.
The embeddings used is an array where each element indicates the exponent for the associated feature. For example, [-1, 0, 1] for features $x$, $y$, $z$ would correspond to the term $z/x$.
